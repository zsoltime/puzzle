# Day 12 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

The 15-Puzzle, I should have made it on my 15th day. This is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.

Why don't you check out some of the other games from my [3 weeks game challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge)?
